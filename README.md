This is one of those frameworks that might give you one of those "how did I survive before" moments. Seriously, it's that good. If you have used code generators and domain driven design before you'd be like - yeah what's the big deal.

The codegen framework generates your Portable domain objects based on a UML model, typically created in Enterprise Architect or similar. The aim is to drive your implementation from a documented model, and guarantee that this model stays in sync with your implementation.

Most projects start with the best of intentions, and loads of technical design documents are produced to represent the domain. As the project progresses, change is introduced to your understanding of the world. Or the business comes up with new ideas. Even with the best of intentions, the documentation of the model gets out of sync.

We can help! What if the documented model is used to generate some of the code automatically? What if the model is the something living, something that business analysts, architects and business users bring into their discussions? Well then you won't have this problem.
